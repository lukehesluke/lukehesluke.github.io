      were developed using this tool, while others can be described using it. -->

      This is my current obsession: the relationship between <a

        construction</a> and traditional design across the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've created a very simple programming language for describing Euclidean
      constructions, and will use this to explore how some of these designs
      could have been (or could be) constructed. Later, I hope to also explore the use of
      extensions to Euclidean construction (e.g. origami) on designs.

          First, a <strong>disclaimer</strong>: I am no expert on maths or art
          history â€”
          <em>far from it!</em>
          I am a programmer. I will try to not make sweeping and incorrect
          generalizations to the best of my ability to suppress that unfortunate
          instinct.

      <h2>Euclidean Construction</h2>
      <p>
        Euclidean construction is a method for constructing figures on a canvas
        with just two tools: a straightedge and a compass.
      </p>

      <div class="example-section">
        <h3>
          Two points
        </h3>
        <p>
          You start with two points <a href="#disclaimer-1">[1]</a>:
        </p>
        <div id="example-start-with-two-points">

        </div>
        <p>
          From this starting point, you can construct anything <a href="#disclaimer-2">[2]</a>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="example-section">
        <h3>Circles</h3>
        <p>
          Place the compass with one end on one point and the other end on another point and you can draw a circle.

      </div>

      <div class="example-section">
        <h3>Lines</h3>
        <p>
          Use the straightedge to draw a line through two points.
        </p>
        <div id="example-line"></div>
        <p>Or a line <em>segment</em> between the two points.</p>

          Intersections

          In this last example, <code>E</code> is also the exact midpoint of

      <h2>Design Examples</h2>

      <p>
        This method of construction has been <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction">well studied mathematically</a>.
        It's also widely used for design, which is what I want to talk about here.

        <h3>Example: London Stone Screen</h3>
        <p>
          I've seen Euclidean construction patterns used to design stone screens
          that are slotted into brick garden walls where I live in London. Here
          are some examples:

            Generally, you can start with some number of figures (e.g. a line, two
            non-overlapping circles, etc). It doesnâ€™t have to be two points, but
            it seems that two points is the simplest beginning from which anything
            can be constructed.

          <li id="disclaimer-2">
            Well, you can construct anything that is constructable ðŸ˜…. It looks
            like, in Euclidâ€™s time, it was assumed that Euclidean Construction was
            sufficient to construct anything that was legal in Euclidean Geometry,
            though this was later found to

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction#Impossible_constructions">not
              be the case</a>.

            However, itâ€™s still rated for its simplicity,
            unambiguity and that it requires no existing system of measurement
            (which can never be fully accurate).

            I was unfortunately not able to find a photo of the original pattern in the Great Mosque of CÃ³rdoba.
