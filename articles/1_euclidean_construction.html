    <h1>Euclidean Construction</h1>
    <p>
      Euclidean Construction is a method for constructing figures on a canvas with just two tools: a straightedge and a
      compass.
    </p>

    <section class="example-section">
      <h3>
        Two points
      </h3>
      <p>
        You start with two points <a href="#disclaimer-1">[1]</a>:
      </p>
      <div id="example-start-with-two-points">
        <div class="example-canvas-loading-wrapper">
          <div class="example-canvas-loader"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        From this starting point, you can construct anything <a href="#disclaimer-2">[2]</a>.

    <section class="example-section">
      <h3>Circles</h3>
      <p>
        Place the compass with one end on one point and the other end on another point and you can draw a circle.
      </p>
      <div id="example-circle">
        <div class="example-canvas-loading-wrapper">
          <div class="example-canvas-loader"></div>

      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="example-section">
      <h3>Lines</h3>
      <p>
        Use the straightedge to draw a line through two points.
      </p>
      <div id="example-line"></div>
      <p>Or a line <em>segment</em> between the two points.</p>

          <div class="example-canvas-loader"></div>

    </section>

    <section class="example-section">
      <h3>
        Intersections
      </h3>
      <p>Define new points at the intersections of two figures</p>

        In this last example, <code>E</code> is also the exact midpoint of
        <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.

          Generally, you can start with some number of figures (e.g. a line, two
          non-overlapping circles, etc). It doesnâ€™t have to be two points, but
          it seems that two points is the simplest beginning from which anything
          can be constructed.
        </li>
        <li id="disclaimer-2">
          Well, you can construct anything that is constructable ðŸ˜…. It looks
          like, in Euclidâ€™s time, it was assumed that Euclidean Construction was
          sufficient to construct anything that was legal in Euclidean Geometry,
          though this was later found to

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction#Impossible_constructions">not
            be the case</a>.

          However, itâ€™s still rated for its simplicity,
          unambiguity and that it requires no existing system of measurement
          (which can never be fully accurate).

    <h1 style="margin-top: 2em;">Euclidean Construction Design</h1>

    <p>
      This method of construction has been <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction">well studied mathematically</a>.
      It's also widely used for design, which is what I want to talk about here.

      <h3>Example: London Stone Screen</h3>
      <p>
        I've seen Euclidean construction patterns used to design stone screens
        that are slotted into brick garden walls where I live in London. Here
        are some examples:

          I was unfortunately not able to find a photo of the original pattern in the Great Mosque of CÃ³rdoba.
          This is an illustration by Ton Esink (<a href="https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/456833955936125145/">source</a>).
          The pattern for forming it was found in the book <a
