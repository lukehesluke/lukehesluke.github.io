    <h1>Euclidean Construction</h1>
    <p>
      Euclidean Construction is a method for constructing figures on a canvas with just two tools: a straightedge and a
      compass.
    </p>

      <h3>
        Two points
      </h3>
      <p>
        You start with two points <a href="#disclaimer-1">[1]</a>:

      <h3>Circles</h3>
      <p>
        Place the compass with one end on one point and the other end on another point and you can draw a circle.

      <h3>Lines</h3>

        Use the straightedge to draw a line through two points.

          Generally, you can start with some number of figures (e.g. a line, two
          non-overlapping circles, etc). It doesnâ€™t have to be two points, but
          it seems that two points is the simplest beginning from which anything
          can be constructed.
        </li>
        <li id="disclaimer-2">
          Well, you can construct anything that is constructable ðŸ˜…. It looks
          like, in Euclidâ€™s time, it was assumed that Euclidean Construction was
          sufficient to construct anything that was legal in Euclidean Geometry,
          though this was later found to

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction#Impossible_constructions">not
            be the case</a>.

          However, itâ€™s still rated for its simplicity,
          unambiguity and that it requires no existing system of measurement
          (which can never be fully accurate).

    <p>
      This method of construction has been <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction">well studied mathematically</a>.
      It's also widely used for design, which is what I want to talk about here.

      <h3>Example: London Stone Screen</h3>
      <p>
        I've seen Euclidean construction patterns used to design stone screens
        that are slotted into brick garden walls where I live in London. Here
        are some examples:
