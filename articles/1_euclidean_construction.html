    <h1>Euclidean Construction Design</h1>
    <p>
      This is my current obsession: the relationship between <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction">Euclidean
        construction</a> and traditional design across the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've created a very simple programming language for describing Euclidean
      constructions, and will use this to explore how some of these designs
      could have been (or could be) constructed. Later, I hope to also explore the use of
      extensions to Euclidean construction (e.g. origami) on these types of designs.

          First, a <strong>disclaimer</strong>: I am no expert on maths or art
          history —
          <em>far from it!</em>
          I am a programmer. I will try to not make sweeping and incorrect
          generalizations to the best of my ability to suppress that unfortunate
          instinct.

      <h2>Euclidean Construction</h2>
      <p>
        Euclidean construction is a method for constructing figures on a canvas
        with just two tools: a straightedge and a compass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the production rules, which will all be demonstrated in an
        interactive demo below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The start</strong>: You start with two points <a href="#disclaimer-1">[1]</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Circle</strong>, or <strong>Arc</strong>: Place the compass
          with one end on one point and the other end on another point and you
          can draw a circle. An arc can be constructed on top of a circle by
          having the "pen" end start at one point and end at another point.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Line</strong>, <strong>Ray</strong>, or <strong>Line
            Segment</strong>: Use the straightedge to draw a line through two
          points, which may be cut off at one or both ends.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Intersection</strong>: Define new points at the intersections
          of two figures. e.g. a line segment and a circle, or two circles, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here is an interactive demo which demonstrates most of these production
        rules.

        This demo was made using a custom programming language for describing
        Euclidean constructions, which will be explained in more detail later
        (though you can see the code that describes it with the "Code" button).

        Use the playback buttons to animate it.
      </p>

        <div class="example-canvas-loading-wrapper">
          <div class="example-canvas-loader"></div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        It's interesting to note that, in this demo example, <code>E</code> is
        also the exact midpoint of
        <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.
      </p>

      <h3>Scope of construction</h3>
      <p>
        These production rules are sufficient to construct many things, but
        are limited.
      </p>
      <p>
        It looks like, in Euclid’s time, it was assumed that Euclidean
        Construction was sufficient to construct anything that was legal in
        Euclidean Geometry, though this was later found to

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction#Impossible_constructions">not
          be the case</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it’s still rated for its simplicity, unambiguity and that it
        requires no system of measurement.

      <h2>Design Examples</h2>

      <p>
        This method of construction has been <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction">well studied mathematically</a>.
        It's also widely used for design, which is what I want to talk about here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are a number of examples of designs that are constructible using
        Euclidean construction. With each example is a picture of how the design
        looks in the real world, followed by an interactive demo, which shows
        the "idealised" form of the construction and the steps that could be
        used to construct it. Again, the playback buttons can be used to animate
        backwards and forwards.

        <h3>Example: London Stone Screen</h3>
        <p>
          I've seen Euclidean construction patterns used to design stone screens
          that are slotted into brick garden walls where I live in London. Here
          are some examples:

          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_geometric_patterns">Islamic geometric patterns</a> are often
          constructed using Euclidean
          construction.

          In this demo, the point names are excluded as there are so many points

            Generally, you can start with some number of figures (e.g. a line, two
            non-overlapping circles, etc). It doesn’t have to be two points, but
            it seems that two points is the simplest beginning from which anything
            can be constructed.

            I was unfortunately not able to find a photo of the original pattern in the Great Mosque of Córdoba.
